### Feb 19, 2020: The goal of this project is to determine if ANNs can write effective code.

## Implementation plan
- [x] Create a directory called "Dataset." Pull various repos into dataset and scan for Python files 
- [x] Write code to concatenate files into one string and encode string as integer values
- [x] Interpret endcoded string in matrix form
- [x] Determine best target (Ex: next letter in block of characters)
- [ ] Build an Recurrent Neural Network to train to predict target
- - [x] One Hot encode data  
- - [ ] Utilize lstm with keras while surpassing memory constraints. Currently 16GB
